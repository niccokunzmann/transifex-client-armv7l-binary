# Transifex Client for Android and Raspberry Pi

This is an informal build of the [Transifex Client](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/) for Raspberry Pi and Android Phones.
This is the architecture it works on:

```
$ uname -m
armv7l
```

You can download the tx file if you are desparate and cannot build it yourself.
